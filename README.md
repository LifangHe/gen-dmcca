# Multiview Shared Subspace Learning for Speakers and Speech Commands  

## Generalized Deep Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis for Multiview Learning of Speech Representations

### Package Requirements  

```
scipy==1.0.0
numpy==1.11.0
Keras==2.2.4
pandas==0.22.0
Theano==1.0.4
matplotlib==2.2.2
resampy==0.2.0

scikit_learn==0.20.3
utils==0.9.0
```

### Proposed Approach:  

We propose a novel direction of multiview learning to obtain speech representations in presence of multiple known sources of variability. We constrain one mode of variability as multiple views and learn features that are discriminative in the other mode.  A schematic to the approach is shown below:
